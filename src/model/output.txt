First visit to nha trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha trang, the capital of khanhs hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of vietnam. In nha trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs; the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters; it all makes for a stunning landscapes. On my visit to nha trang, i used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach a chance to breath in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water. One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands. Hon tre is the largest of the islands, and monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys. Yen island is known for its swiftsâ€™ nests. Nha trang is the city in hamoney: its fine weather, favorite position and friendly.Ple bring it a cerain balance. Nha trang.A great holiday destination. I hope to have.Nce to come back.
